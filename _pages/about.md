I am a second-year PhD Candidate in Economics, jointly enrolled at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Italy) and Université Panthéon-Sorbonne (France). I am conducting my work under the supervision of [Prof. Fabio Montobbio](https://sites.google.com/site/montobbiofabio/) and [Prof. Lorenzo Cassi](https://lorenzocassi.wordpress.com/cv/). My research interest lies at the intersection of Development Economics and Innovation, with a particular emphasis on structural change, de-industrialization, and economic growth. In this setting, the first chapter of my dissertation explores recomposition dynamics within manufacturing and examines how labor shifts across sub-sectors have affected labor productivity of the industrial sector.

I hold an M.Phil. in Development Economics from Université Panthéon-Sorbonne and an M.Phil. in Social Sciences from the Institute of Latin American Studies. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics at the Clermont-Auvergne University. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out - I would be delighted to discuss with you!
