<p>
  I am a second-year PhD Candidate in Economics, jointly enrolled at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Italy) and Université Panthéon-Sorbonne (France). I am conducting my work under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/montobbiofabio/" target="_blank" style="color: #800020; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Fabio Montobbio</a> 
  and 
  <a href="https://lorenzocassi.wordpress.com/cv/" target="_blank" style="color: #800020; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Lorenzo Cassi</a>. 
  My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics and innovation, with a particular focus on structural change, deindustrialisation, commodities-shocks and economic growth. I investigate these macro-development dynamics from a long-term perspective, drawing on micro-level data and applying latest quantitative methods. In this setting, the first chapter of my dissertation explores recomposition dynamics within manufacturing and examines how labor shifts across sub-sectors have affected labor productivity of the industrial sector.

I hold an M.Phil. in Development Economics from Université Panthéon-Sorbonne and an M.Phil. in Social Sciences from the Institute of Latin American Studies. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics at the Clermont-Auvergne University.
